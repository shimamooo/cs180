        In the last 9 months, we've worked with 10+ growth equity funds, ranging
        from $100M to $2B AUM. We hear lots of funny (and horrifying) war
        stories. Here are some highlights: <br />
        <br />
        ** Anonymized for confidentiality ** <br />‚Ä¢ A VP accidentally sent
        their brutally honest IC memo to the target company's entire management
        team in a reply-all. The memo included "CEO gets defensive about churn
        metrics" and "CTO seems overwhelmed." They lost the deal and now their
        banker jokes about it every time they chat.

        In 24 hours I met founders who ship faster than most teams brainstorm
        and soaked up lessons from the people actually pushing the frontier.
        Five takeaways worth sharing:
        <br /> <br />
        1. Ambition is the only ceiling. Garry Tan opened with a clear reminder:
        AI turns individual effort into outsized leverage. The bottleneck now is
        how big you‚Äôre willing to think.
        <br />
        2. ‚ÄúImpossible‚Äù ages quickly. Sam Altman skipped the AGI quest because
        it sounded absurd. Five years later it feels inevitable. Bet on the
        future you want.
        <br />
        3. Naive questions build new rules.{" "}
